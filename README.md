# Free Damped-Logarithmic Decrement Vibrations
Stimulation of Vibration Using MATLAB

## Project Introduction
In this experiment, viscous damping will be studied, which is modeled as a piston-cylinder system with oil inside (Figure 1). The piston has several holes so that the oil can pass from one chamber to the other. This movement requires a force to overcome the developed shear stress of the oil (from fluid mechanics). This force is the damping force, which is proportional to the piston's speed. If this damper is added to the mass-spring system, part of the mechanical energy will be dissipated into heat in the oil. As a result, due to this dissipation, the vibrations decay over time.

## Project Objectives
- Study and understand the characteristics of viscous damping
- Analyze the logarithmic decay of free vibrations in the mass-spring-damper system
- Evaluate the effect of damper parameters on the vibration behavior of the system

## Features
- Modeling of the piston-cylinder damper system
- Analysis of the damping force and its effect on free vibrations
- Simulation and investigation of the logarithmic decay pattern of vibrations
